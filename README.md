# Adaptive-Incremental-Learning-for-Intrusion-Detection-in-IoT-Networks

## Description

The widespread adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has created new cybersecurity 
challenges, demanding innovative strategies to protect interconnected systems from evolving 
threats. I proposed a fresh approach to IoT device security through a Network Intrusion 
Detection System (NIDS) enhanced with adaptive incremental online learning techniques. I 
trained various machine learning algorithms using IoT network data and pinpoint the most effective 
algorithm based on accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for detecting intrusions in IoT 
environments. With this knowledge, I developed a robust ML-based NIDS model tailored 
specifically for IoT security.
